# plancton_visualizer_server
Server-side part of the plankton-data-visualization project. Provides the data to render with the [**plancton_visualizer**](https://github.com/garciacelisandres/plancton_visualizer) repository.

This repository makes use of the **quantificationlib** library; this library is currently private and, therefore, not provided in this repository.
